# Stopwatch - Android(JAVA) Application

This is a Stopwatch & Timer app that can run in the background and can show the time accordingly. It was a project for my university course CSE489 Mobile Application Development Midterm exam. Our main task was to complete the app using services. So I use service class and broadcast the time in milliseconds to show the time in screen. Ui is fully responsive.


## Features

- Simple Ui
- can perform as a timer as well
- Show Lap for stopwatch
- Play, Pause and stop button
- Used froground service so that app can run even in locked screen and backgound
- Responsive ui
- Small in size
