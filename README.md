# Stopwatch - Android(JAVA) Application

A Stopwatch & Timer app that can run in the background and can show the time accordingly. It was a project for my university course CSE489 Mobile Application Development Midterm exam. Our main task was to complete the app using services. So I used service class and broadcast receiver to cast the time in milliseconds. And Update foreground with converted Hours: Minute: Second. milliseconds format. App UI is fully responsive. but supports only portrait mode.


## Features
